# Intro Slides

Review the recent history of Ruby vulnerabilities with us in this [slide deck](https://github.com/trailofbits/presentations/tree/master/Ruby%20Security%20Overview). We'll cover the rash of exploitable bugs that Rails was hit with in early 2013 and introduce some of the exercises in this guide.

The slides are developed with [Slippy](https://github.com/Seldaek/slippy) and can be viewed in your browser, or with the included PDF.
