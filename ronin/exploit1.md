# Ronin Exploit 1

Rewrite one of your YAML exploits using the [ronin-support](http://ronin-ruby.github.com/docs/ronin-support/frames) library. Some boilerplate code already exists in `exploit.rb`.

To test your new exploit, go back to the original YAML exploit and start it's
server:

    $ cd ../yaml/level3/
    $ ./app.rb
    [2013-05-17 18:05:07] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
    [2013-05-17 18:05:07] INFO  ruby 1.9.3 (2013-02-22) [x86_64-linux]
    == Sinatra/1.3.5 has taken the stage on 9000 for development with backup from WEBrick
    [2013-05-17 18:05:07] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=4037 port=9000

Then draw your sword:

    $ ./exploit.rb "puts 'lol'"
    [-] Exploiting http://localhost:9000/ ...
    [-] Success!

    lol
    Received #<Callbacks: {"REDACTED"=>[true]}>
    localhost.localdomain - - [17/May/2013:18:06:16 PDT] "POST / HTTP/1.1" 200 7
    - -> /

Success indeed.
