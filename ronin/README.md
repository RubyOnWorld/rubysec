# Ronin

Welcome to the Ronin exercise! Masterless Samurai rejoice.

In this exercise you will learn how to leverage [Ronin](http://ronin-ruby.github.com/) in order to perform security testing. [Ronin](http://ronin-ruby.github.com/) is actually a fairly large project comprised of many different libraries for writing [Exploits](https://github.com/ronin-ruby/ronin-exploits#readme), [Shellcode](https://github.com/ronin-ruby/ronin-asm#readme), [Scanners](https://github.com/ronin-ruby/ronin-scanners#readme), [Bruteforcers](https://github.com/ronin-ruby/ronin-bruteforcers#readme), etc. For this exercise we will focus on using the [ronin-support](http://ronin-ruby.github.com/docs/ronin-support/frames) library.

## ronin-support

[ronin-support](http://ronin-ruby.github.com/docs/ronin-support/frames) is similar to [activesupport](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activesupport#readme) of Rails. It provides all the convenience methods and Mixins used in the Ronin Console or for writing [Exploits](https://github.com/ronin-ruby/ronin-exploits#readme). Just using [ronin-support](http://ronin-ruby.github.com/docs/ronin-support/frames) you can quickly write PoC exploits to demonstrate vulnerabilities.
