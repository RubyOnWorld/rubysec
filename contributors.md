# Contributors
This book was built on a lot of hard work, most of which happened elsewhere. In particular, the authors of [Parslet](https://github.com/kschiess) and [Mutant](https://github.com/mbj) have our gratitude and admiration.

* [Hal Brodigan](https://github.com/postmodern) developed the initial course, slides, and code.
* [Davis Gallinghouse](https://twitter.com/dgalling) wrote speaker notes and refined the exercises in each section.
* [Nick Anderson](https://github.com/PoppySeedPlehzr) beta tested the entire course and added content where it needed more.
