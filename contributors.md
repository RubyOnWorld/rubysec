# Contributors
This book was built on a lot of hard work, most of which happened elsewhere. In particular, the authors of [Parslet](https://github.com/kschiess) and [Mutant](https://github.com/mbj) have our gratitude and admiration.

* [Hal Brodigan](https://github.com/postmodern) developed the initial slides and code
* [Davis Gallinghouse](https://twitter.com/dgalling) wrote speaker notes and refined the exercises
* [Nick Anderson](https://github.com/PoppySeedPlehzr)  tested the entire course
