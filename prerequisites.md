# Prerequisites
Readers should have an intermediate level of understanding of Ruby and a laptop with Ruby >= 1.9.2 installed (you can use RVM to do this).

In order to help prospective readers evaluate whether they are prepared for this course, take this short self-assessment questionnaire. You should be able to answer these questions with relative ease in order to get the most out of the exercises.

 * Are you familiar with the command line?
 * Have you ever refactored existing Ruby code?
 * Have you ever written unit tests?
 * Have you ever written YAML by hand?
 * Have you ever used `instanceeval`, `classeval`, or `module_eval`?
